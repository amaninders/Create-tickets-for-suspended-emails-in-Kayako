[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

This chrome extension will allow you to create a customer ticket for any email suspended by Kayako for any reason. As long as an email has valid contents in the text/html fields, you can use this extension to create tickets

## Description âœ¨

This chrome extension adds an option which works in the same way as default option provided by Kayako to allow suspended messages. However, we know that the default option only works for certain type of suspended messages, but this extension goes a step further and allows you to convert any suspended message into a Kayako ticket.  

## Installation ðŸ’»

- Open the Google Chrome browser
- Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the spanner icon and choose Tools > Extensions
- Tick the developer mode checkbox in the top right corner.
- Click 'Load unpacked extension' and select your folder (enclosed with this post) and click 'OK'. If all the files are valid and named correctly, a blue chrome icon should appear next to the address bar with the other extensions. 

Note: You'll need to unzip/extract the attached file to its own folder before using it as an extension. Also, you'll need to refresh the browser tabs and reopen the case again to before using this extension for the first time
